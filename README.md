# Youtube Manager (CLI) — Python + SQLite

Small command-line Youtube Manager that helps perform CRUD operations in a local SQLite database.

## Features
- Add, list, update and delete videos
- Persistent storage in `youtube_manager.db`
- Minimal, dependency-free (uses Python standard library sqlite3)

## Requirements
- Python 3.8+ (sqlite3 is part of the standard library)

## Quick start

1. Open Terminal and change to the project folder:
```bash

```

2. (Optional) Create and activate a virtual environment:
```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
```

3. Run the app:
```bash
python3 youtube_manager.py
```

## Usage
- The app shows a numeric menu. Type the menu number (e.g. `1`) and press Enter.
- Example flow:
  - Choose `2` to add a video → enter name and time (e.g. `10:23`).
  - Choose `1` to list videos.
  - Choose `3` or `4` to update or delete by the video `id`.
  - Choose `5` to exit.

Notes:
- `input()` returns strings, so comparing to `"1"` is correct for menu choices.
- When listing, each row is printed as `(id, name, time)`. You can edit `list_videos()` to format output differently.
- Leading/trailing whitespace from user input can be removed with `.strip()` if desired.

## Database details
- File: `youtube_manager.db` (created automatically on first run)
- Table: `videos(id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY, name TEXT NOT NULL, time TEXT NOT NULL)`
- IDs are auto-generated by SQLite and may not start at `1` if rows were previously created and deleted.
- To reset data and IDs (destructive): delete `youtube_manager.db`:
  ```bash
  rm youtube_manager.db
  ```

## Development tips
- To access columns by name instead of tuples:
  ```python
  con.row_factory = sqlite3.Row
  ```
- Always call `con.commit()` after inserts/updates/deletes (the app already does).
